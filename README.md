A small project I undertook in community college, with some additions over time. A Discord bot, run locally, that uses extensive regex to roll dice, up to 99-sided die. Supports basic arithmetic, multi-dice running, running multiple groups, and adding bonuses. 
Also tracks dice-rolling statistics through SQLite on a user-to-user basis for each of the basic 7 dice for D&D -- D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, and D20. Also has specific messages for critical failures (a one on any die) and critical successes (the max value on any die.)
The DiceRolled.db is a database file for my personal group of friends.
